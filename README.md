Emoji based Pairs game experiment with Client Side Blazor. 

Mainly an exercise in familiarising myself with Client Side Blazor. 

Uses [Fluxor](https://github.com/mrpmorris/blazor-fluxor) for state management and [Blazor PWA Builder](https://github.com/SQL-MisterMagoo/Blazor.PWA.MSBuild) for PWA functionality.

- [x] Initial game logic
- [x] State store
- [ ] Improve styles and layout
- [ ] PWA functionality
- [ ] Leaderboard save functionality via IndexedDb
- [ ] Add some animal sound assets

Potentially

- [ ] Server side version
- [ ] Alternative means of managing state
